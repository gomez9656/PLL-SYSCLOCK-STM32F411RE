Short example for PLL configuration as the system clock. 
 
I use the HSI as the input clock, and create some APIs to configure the PLL to 50MHz, 84MHz and 120MHz.

With the USART2 configuration used in the USART2-example repository I show the values in the serual monitor. You can use TerraTerm to see the values
